This was a very tough assignment as it had issues related to unable to fetch due to unrelated histories as well as wrong origin.

I was unable to push the main branch from local repo to remote so I have to delete the local repo and perform the following commands

git init
git branch -M main
<creating gitignore file via VS code to ignore ./vs folder>
git add .
git commit -m "<message>" 
git remote -v
git remote add origin <Github-repo-URL>
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
